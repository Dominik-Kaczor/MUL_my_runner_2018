# MUL_my_runner_2018
Endless running game

Description:

The basic rules for the my_runner are as follows:

•the player is a character who runs in a map you took as parameter.

•enemies and obstacles must appear on the opposite side to the player position.

•the player can use the space bar to jump and avoid obstacles and enemies.

•as the player runs, a score, which will be displayed, will increase.

•when the player dies or finishes the map, the score is displayed inside the window.

As you previously did, being able to manage inputs from the user and to display animated sprites are keyskills when you want to develop basic games. Furthermore, you will need to manage various new gamemaking skills such as:

•reading a file describing an environnement and use it to render a visual.

•manage basic game physics.

•manage multiple entities at the same time.
